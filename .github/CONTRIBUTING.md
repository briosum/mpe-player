Creating an Issue

Use the Template that we provide.  Issues reported that do not use the Issue Template will likely be rejected.


Creating a Pull Request
---

Before you can submit a PR, you will need to:

1. Clone this repo
2. Make a New Branch ( ideally you will name your branch for the issue you are fixing, e,g, `issue-3-updating-docs` )
3. Commit & Push the New Branch

Now you can submit a new PR using the Template that we provide.  PR's submitted that do not use the PR Template will likely be rejected.
